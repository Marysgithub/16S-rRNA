Step 6. Build a phylogenetic tree #构建进化树
The filtered alignment file produced in the directory otus/pynast_aligned_seqs/ is then used to build a phylogenetic tree using a tree-building program.
#过滤好的aligned_pfiltered.fasta格式的文件用来构建进化树
The Newick format tree file is written to rep_set.tre, which is located in the otus/ directory . This file can be viewed in tree visualization software, and is necessary for UniFrac diversity measurements and other phylogenetically-aware analyses (described below). 
#用的是Newick格式的建树文件，文件名：rep_set.tre, 就在otus/根目录下，是 UniFrac多样性分析的必要文件
The tree obtained can be visualized with programs such as FigTree, which was used to visualize the phylogenetic tree stored in rep_set.tre:
#对Newick文件可视化的看树软件有三种，其中之一是FigTree

下载安装FigTree, 用java打开API，导入tre图，得到的是一张硕大无比的黑乎乎的无根树？问号脸~
