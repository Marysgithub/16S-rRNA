## De novo OTU picking                      
eg:  pick_de_novo_otus.py -i split_library_output/seqs.fna -o otus           
我的：pick_de_novo_otus.py -i fastaqual/trim.INq_a.fna -o otus
以此类推，trim.INq_b.fna
                  c.fna
                  ...

The results of pick_de_novo_otus.py are in otus/, and a description of the steps performed and the results follow:
# otu的运算结果被一揽子放入了otus文件夹，开始分析都是些什么结果

Step 1. Pick OTUs based on sequence similarity within the reads¶ # 基于序列相似性在reads里挑出OTUs

At this step, all of the sequences from all of the samples will be clustered into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) based on their sequence similarity.
#聚类出OTUS
OTUs in QIIME are clusters of sequences, frequently intended to represent some degree of taxonomic relatedness. 
#QIIME里的OTUs是一簇簇的序列， 常代表了不同程度的 种类的相关性
For example, when sequences are clustered at 97% sequence similarity, each resulting cluster is typically thought of as representing a species. 
#例如，序列相似性为97%时， 每个聚类结果就代表了一个物种
This model and the current techniques for picking OTUs are known to be flawed, however, in that 97% OTUs do not match what humans have called species for many microbes. 
#现有技术还不成熟， 有些即便聚出来也和已知的微生物物种对不上
Determining exactly how OTUs should be defined, and what they represent, is an active area of research. See here for more information about OTU picking with QIIME.
